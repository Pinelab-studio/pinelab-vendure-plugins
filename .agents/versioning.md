- We use semantic versioning for our packages.
- When asked to bump the version of a package
  - Ask the developer to make this a major, minor or patch version increase.
  - Increase the version numner in the package.json file.
  - Ask the developer for a short description of the changes and add those changes as bullet points in the CHANGELOG.md file.
