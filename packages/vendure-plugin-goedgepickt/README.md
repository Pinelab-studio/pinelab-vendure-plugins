# Vendure GoedGepickt plugin

### [Official documentation here](https://plugins.pinelab.studio/plugin/vendure-plugin-goedgepickt)

Plugin for integrating Vendure with GoedGepickt.

## Getting started

Vendure's responsibilities vs GoedGepickt's responsibilities:

- Vendure is your catalog. If you want a new product, add it in Vendure
- GoedGepickt manages all things stock related. StockLevel, size and weight are all managed in GoedGepickt.

1. Add this to your plugin in `vendure-config.ts`:

```ts
import { GoedgepicktPlugin } from '@pinelab/vendure-plugin-goedgepickt';

plugins: [
  GoedgepicktPlugin.init({
    vendureHost: 'https://your-vendure-server.io/',
    endpointSecret: 'some-secret', // Used to validate incoming requests to /fullsync
    setWebhook: true // Automatically set webhooks in Goedgepickt or not
    // You can optionally set orders 'on_hold' in Goedgepickt if you'd like
    determineOrderStatus: (ctx, order) => {
      if (order.state === 'PaymentAuthorized') {
        return 'on_hold' as const;
      } else {
        return 'open' as const; // This is the default
      }
    }
  }),
  ...
]
```

2. Run a [database migration](https://www.vendure.io/docs/developer-guide/migrations/) to add the new fields and
   entities to your database.
3. Add this plugin to your Admin UI and compile.

```ts
plugins: [
  AdminUiPlugin.init({
    port: 3002,
    route: 'admin',
    app: compileUiExtensions({
      outputPath: path.join(__dirname, '__admin-ui'),
      extensions: [GoedgepicktPlugin.ui],
    }),
  }),
];
```

Read more about Admin UI compilation in the Vendure
[docs](https://www.vendure.io/docs/plugins/extending-the-admin-ui/#compiling-as-a-deployment-step)

4. Start the server and navigate to `Settings > Goedgepickt`. Make sure you have the `SetGoedGepicktConfig` permission.
5. Here you can configure your `apiKey` and `webshopUuid` per channel.
6. Click `test` to check your credentials.

When you save the credentials, the plugin will make sure the configured vendureHost is set as webhook for order and
stock updates. **The plugin will never delete webhooks**, so if you ever change your url, you should manually delete the
old webhook via GoedGepickt.

7. Full sync can be run manually via the Admin ui or via a GET request to
   endpoint`/goedgepickt/fullsync/<webhook-secret>/`. A full sync is processed in the worker and can take a few hours to
   finish

### Pickup points / drop off points

This plugin uses custom fields on an order as pickup location address. You can set a pickup points on an order with this
mutation, the plugin will then send the address to Goedgepickt:

```graphql
mutation {
  setOrderCustomFields(
    input: {
      customFields: {
        pickupLocationNumber: "1234"
        pickupLocationCarrier: "1"
        pickupLocationName: "Local shop"
        pickupLocationStreet: "Shopstreet"
        pickupLocationHouseNumber: "13"
        pickupLocationZipcode: "8888HG"
        pickupLocationCity: "Leeuwarden"
        pickupLocationCountry: "nl"
      }
    }
  ) {
    ... on Order {
      id
      code
    }
    ... on NoActiveOrderError {
      errorCode
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

You should monitor your server logs for the message `Failed to process job sync-order` with severity WARNING. This means an order was not pushed to GoedGepickt. Depending on your job queue implementation this will be retried.

In Google Cloud, we create an alert for the following log query:

```
severity>=WARNING
"Failed to process job sync-order"
```
