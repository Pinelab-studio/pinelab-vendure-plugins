# 2.0.0 (2025-07-11)

- Added support for presets. The first time you set presets, or change preset settings, you will need to regenerate the presets for all existing assets with `generateGoogleStorageAssetPresets`.
- Breaking: Config is now passed into `GoogleStorageAssetsPlugin.init({})`, instead of to the `GoogleStorageStrategy` constructor
- Breaking: `Asset.thumbnail` is now deprecated, use `Asset.presets.<presetName>` instead. `Asset.thumbnail` still resolves to old thumbnails, **but will not work for new assets**
- Breaking: A database migration is needed, because a custom field is added to the `Asset` entity for saving the presets.
